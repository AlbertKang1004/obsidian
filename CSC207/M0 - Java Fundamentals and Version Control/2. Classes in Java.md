## Variables in Classes
There are two kinds of variables we can declare for classes:
1. **Instance Variables** : Every instance of the class will contain its own instance of each of these variables. 
	- They come into existence when the instance is constructed (using `new` keyword)
2. **Class Variables** : Also known as **static variables**, all instances of a class share a *single*  instance of each class variable.
	- Updating this variable in one instance of a class will reflect across every instance of the class.

## Visibility and Access Modifiers

|  Modifier   | Class | Package | Subclasses | Global |
| :---------: | :---: | :-----: | :--------: | :----: |
|  `public`   |   O   |    O    |     O      |   O    |
| `protected` |   O   |    O    |     O      |   X    |
|  `package`  |   O   |    O    |     X      |   X    |
|  `private`  |   O   |    X    |     X      |   X    |
- If no access modifier keyword is included, the variable is `package-protected` which is equal to `protected` but excludes subclass access from outside the package.

## Constructors
```java
public Something() {
	this.name = "jake"
	this.size = 1
}

public Something(String name, int size) {
	this.name = name;
	this.size = size;
}
```
- We can define as many constructors as we want as long as the **method signatures** are different. 
- `this` is a reference to the object whose method or constructor is being executed.
