>We use `javax.swing` package to create an user interface.
## Creating and Showing a Window
```java
JFrame frame = new JFrame();
// creates a window (defined by javax.swing.JFrame)
frame.setMinimumSize(new java.awt.Dimension(300, 200));
// sets its minimum size
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
// sets it to quit the program when you click the close button
frame.pack();
// sets its minimum size
frame.setVisible(true);
// shows it by setting its visibility to true
```
We need the code to be placed inside: 
```java
SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> {
	// code you want to execute
})
```
due to how threading works.

## Visual Components
### Layout
![[Swing 2.png|300]]
The window has the following **components**:
- `JLabel` with text `First Name: `, `Last Name: `
- Text fields defined with `JTextField` next to each label
- `JButton` with text `Submit`, `Cancel`

There are also **containers** called `JPanel`s. 
- They can be oriented horizontally (default), or vertically
- Each `JLabel` and `JTextField` pair are grouped together to a `JPanel`
- The two `JButton`s are also grouped together to a `JPanel`
- Those 3 `JPanel`s are together inside another `JPanel`, which we call **main panel**.

The whole window is a `JFrame`.
- The enclosing `JPanel` goes in the content pane of the `JFrame`.

```java
	JPanel firstNamePanel = new JPanel();
	firstNamePanel.add(new JLabel("First Name:"));
	firstNamePanel.add(new JTextField(10));
```
- We create the first name `JPanel` and `JTextField`, and add them to a `JPanel`.
```java
	JPanel mainPanel = new JPanel();
	mainPanel.setLayout(new BoxLayout(mainPanel, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS));
	// set the panel contents to flow vertically
	mainPanel.add(firstNamePanel);
	mainPanel.add(lastNamePanel);
	mainPanel.add(buttonPanel);
```
- By default, `JPanel` contents flow left to right.
- If we use `setLayout` method, we can change how `JPanel` contents flow.

## Handling Events
### Layout
![[Swing 2.png|300]]
Recall the `Submit` button.
```java
JButton submit = new JButton("Submit");
```

```java
submit.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        String firstName = firstNameField.getText();
        String lastName = lastNameField.getText();
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Hello " + firstName + " " + lastName);
    }
});
```
- Method for `JButton` is always called `actionPerformed`. 
- `new ActionListner() { ... }` part creates an anonymous (nameless) class that contains one method, `actionPerformed`.
