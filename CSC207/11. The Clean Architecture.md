## The Dependency Rule
- The **Clean Architecture** has one rule, called the "**Dependency Rule**". 
- This rule states that the dependencies in our system must all point inwards —  from lower-level policies to higher-level policies

### Frameworks and Drivers
#### View
Displays information and reacts to user interaction. 
- The **View** will ask a **Controller** to do something user wants. 
- The information that the **View** displays is stored in **View Model**.
- When the **View Model** is updated, the **View** is alerted and will display the new information to the user.
#### Data Access
Reads and write persistent data to a file or database outside the program. 
- It implements its method from the **Data Access Interface** specified by the <u><b>Use Case</b></u> layer. 
- It will create temporary **Entities** that the <u><b>Use Case</b></u> uses to do its work.
### Interface Adapters
#### Controller
- Converts the raw user data to something useful (ex. `String`  →  `Date` ).
- Creates an **Input Data** object containing that information.
- Calls a method to start a <u><b>Use Case</b></u>, passing in the **Input Data**.
#### Presenter
- Receives information as **Output Data** object from the **Use Case Interactor** and turns it into raw strings and numbers to be displayed. 
- Then, it updates the **View Model** with this information.
#### View Model
A storage class for information the **View** needs to display.
- The **View** accesses the **View Model** for any information it needs.
### Application Business Rules (Use Cases)

#### Input Data
- The **Controller** creates this object and stores input from the user in it. 
- Later passed to the **Use Case Interactor**.
- Designed to be in a format most convenient for the Use Case Interactor to do its job.
