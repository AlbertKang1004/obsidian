## The Dependency Rule
- The **Clean Architecture** has one rule, called the "**Dependency Rule**". 
- This rule states that the dependencies in our system must all point inwards —  from lower-level policies to higher-level policies
## The Clean Architecture with SOLID Principle
- Adheres to **[[9. Design Principles#Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)|Single Responsibility Principle]]**
	- Clean Architecture follows SRP as each layer of Use Cases has a clearly defined responsibility.
- Adheres to **[[9. Design Principles#Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)|Dependency Inversion Principle]]**
	- Clean Architecture follows DIP by having high-level modules depend only on abstractions not on low-level details. 
	- Low-level modules implement these abstractions, so all dependencies point inward toward the core logic.

### Frameworks and Drivers
#### View
Displays information and reacts to user interaction. 
- The **View** will ask a **Controller** to do something user wants. 
- The information that the **View** displays is stored in **View Model**.
- When the **View Model** is updated, the **View** is alerted and will display the new information to the user.
#### Data Access
Reads and write persistent data to a file or database outside the program. 
- It implements its method from the **Data Access Interface** specified by the <u><b>Use Case</b></u> layer. 
- It will create temporary **Entities** that the <u><b>Use Case</b></u> uses to do its work.
### Interface Adapters
#### Controller
- Converts the raw user data to something useful (ex. `String`  →  `Date` ).
- Creates an **Input Data** object containing that information.
- Calls a method to start a <u><b>Use Case</b></u>, passing in the **Input Data**.
#### Presenter
- Receives information as **Output Data** object from the **Use Case Interactor** and turns it into raw strings and numbers to be displayed. 
- Then, it updates the **View Model** with this information.
#### View Model
A storage class for information the **View** needs to display.
- The **View** accesses the **View Model** for any information it needs.
### Application Business Rules (Use Cases)

#### Input Data
- The **Controller** creates this object and stores input from the user in it. 
- Later passed to the **Use Case Interactor**.
- Designed to be in a format most convenient for the Use Case Interactor to do its job.
#### Use Case Interactor
- Takes the **Input Data** and executes the <b><u>Use Case</b></u>.
- Looks up information in the **Data Access Object** when necessary.
- Manipulates **Entities**, which might create new data that needs to be saved through a **Data Access Object**.
- When complete, create an **Output Data** object (the <b><u>Use Case</b></u> result) and pass it to the **Presenter**.
#### Output Data
Represents the result of executing the **Use Case Interactor**.
- The **Use Case Interactor** creates this object and sends it to the **Presenter** through the **Output Boundary**.
#### Input Boundary
Implemented by a **Use Case Interactor**.
- **Controller** classes call the methods in this interface.
#### Output Boundary
Implemented by a **Presenter**.
- **Use Case Interactor** calls the methods in this interface.
#### Data Access Interface
Implemented by a **Data Access** class.
- Specifies how the **Use Case Interactor** will need to access data in order to perform its job.
### Enterprise Business Rules
#### Entities
Class that stores information about the building blocks of your program. 
- For example, a car rental app will have `Car`, `Renter` entities, and so on.
