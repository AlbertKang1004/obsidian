## Material and Relational Harms
> When do you design software, who do you imagine is going to use it?

The reasons why some are excluded from the user of an application is...
1. Language is the typical way that we communicatee meaning to each other.
	- However, other things can communicate meaning too:
		- Artifacts
		- Actions
		- Decisions
2. Philosopher J.L. Austin suggests that some forms of communication do more than convey information — they directly make changes in the world. These are called **speech acts**. 
	- Apologies
	- Promises
	- Official Declarations
3. Philosopher Elizabeth Anderson talks about the idea of **relational equality** or **democratic equality**: being able to relate to someone as an equal
	- Not about who has what tangible things, but comparative status.

Some design decisions that exclude people are speech acts: 
- They express that those people are less than equal
- They have the power to demote those people's status
- This may be intentional or unintentional

**Relational Harms**: harms that come from someone expressing that another person is less than equal
**Material Harms**: all other harms (like the harms we identified earlier caused by exclusion from various apps — harms to happiness, health, freedom, social options...)
> When do words or actions cause relational harms?

Some factors that may contribute to relational harms: 
1. Does the person making the decision have authority?
2. What is the subject matter of exclusion? Is it closely connected to personal dignity or more trivial?
3. Who is being excluded? Do they belong to a sensitive group?
	- Some groups of people seem to be more vulnerable to relational harm through exclusion because of history, etc.
	- The relational harm is worst when all and only members of a sensitive group are excluded.
	- It is less relationally harmful if some but not all members of a sensitive group are excluded.
	- It is less relationally harmful if some members of a non-sensitive group are simultaneously excluded.

One set of users whose needs may differ from the average user are those with disabilities. 
> The WHO estimates that 15% of users have disabilities.

### What do disabilities have in common with each other?
> A disability is a physical or mental impairment that is associated with a personal or social limitation on the activities one can perform.

- Physical or mental impairment (e.g. paraplegia)
- Personal / social limitation (e.g. not being able to access public spaces)

Normally we think of the **"cause"** of an event as another specific event that occurred before it.
Other factors are simply **"background conditions"** - required for the event to happen, but not part of the cause.
For some disabilities, the limitations are caused by the **physical or mental impairment**.
The **environment** is a background condition.
However, the Social Model of Disability thinks otherwise:
The limitations are caused by the **environment**, and the **impairment** is a background condition.
