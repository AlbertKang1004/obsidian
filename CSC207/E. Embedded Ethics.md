## Relational and Material Harms
> When do you design software, who do you imagine is going to use it?

The reasons why some are excluded from the user of an application is...
1. Language is the typical way that we communicatee meaning to each other.
	- However, other things can communicate meaning too:
		- Artifacts
		- Actions
		- Decisions
2. **Speech Acts**
3. Philosopher Elizabeth Anderson talks about the idea of **relational equality** or **democratic equality**: being able to relate to someone as an equal
	- Not about who has what tangible things, but comparative status.
### Speech Acts
>Philosopher J.L. Austin suggests that some forms of communication do more than convey information — they directly make changes in the world. These are called **speech acts**. 
-  Apologies
- Promises
- Official Declarations

Some design decisions that exclude people are **speech acts**: 
- They express that those people are less than equal
- They have the power to demote those people's status
- This may be intentional or unintentional
### Relational Harm
>Harms that come from someone expressing that another person is less than equal

**Some factors that may contribute to relational harms**: 
1. Does the person making the decision have authority?
2. What is the subject matter of exclusion? Is it closely connected to personal dignity or more trivial?
3. Who is being excluded? Do they belong to a sensitive group?
	- Some groups of people seem to be more vulnerable to relational harm through exclusion because of history, etc.
	- The relational harm is worst when all and only members of a sensitive group are excluded.

	- It is less relationally harmful if some but not all members of a sensitive group are excluded.

	- It is less relationally harmful if some members of a non-sensitive group are simultaneously excluded.

### Material Harm
>All other harms (like the harms we identified earlier caused by exclusion from various apps — harms to happiness, health, freedom, social options...)
## What do disabilities have in common with each other?
> A disability is a physical or mental impairment that is associated with a personal or social limitation on the activities one can perform.

- Physical or mental impairment (e.g. paraplegia)
- Personal / social limitation (e.g. not being able to access public spaces)

### The Medical Model of Disability
![Medical Model of Disability|500](images/Medical%20Model%20of%20Disability.md)
- The limitations are caused by the **physical or mental impairment**.
- The **environment** is a background condition.
- It would be easier/better to reduce the **impairment** (if we could).

### The Social Model of Disability
![Social Model of Disability|500](images/Social%20Model%20of%20Disability.md)
- The limitations are caused by the **environment**
- The **impairment** is a background condition. 
- It would be easier/better to change the **environment** (if we could).

## The Way of Solving the Problem by Models
### Medical Model
>Intervention reduces the impairment

- "Closer" to the impairment
- Can work for one person without working for everyone
- Person with impairment must to do something to "install" or "trigger"
- Designed with a particular impairment in mind

### Social Model
>Intervention prevents impairment from causing limitations

- "Further" from the impairment
- Applies to everyone; cannot apply to just one person
- Requires little work for the person with impairment to "install" or "trigger"
- May be designed with a particular impairment in mind or none in particular in mind
## Principles of Universal Design

### 1. Equitable Use
>The design is **useful and marketable** to people with diverse abilities.

- Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not.
- Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.
- Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users.
- Make the design appealing to all users.
### 2. Flexibility in Use
>The design **accommodates a wide range** of individual preferences and abilities.

 - Provide choice in methods of use.
 - Accommodate right-or left-handed access and use.
 - Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.
 - Provide adaptability to the user's pace.
### 3. Simple and Intuitive Use
>Use of the design is **easy to understand**, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.

- Eliminate unnecessary complexity.
- Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.
- Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.
- Arrange information consistent with its importance.
- Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion.
### 4. Perceptible Information
>The design **communicates necessary information effectively** to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.

- Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information.
- Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings.
- Maximize "legibility" of essential information.
- Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (i.e., make it easy to give instructions or directions).
- Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with sensory limitations.
### 5. Tolerance for Error
>The design **minimizes hazards** and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.

- Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded.
- Provide warnings of hazards and errors.
- Provide fail safe features.
- Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.
### 6. Low Physical Effort
>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.

- Allow user to maintain a neutral body position. 
- Use reasonable operating forces.
- Minimize repetitive actions.
- Minimize sustained physical effort.
### 7. Size and Space for Approach and Use
>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.

- Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user.
- Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user.
- Accommodate variations in hand and grip size.
- Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance.
