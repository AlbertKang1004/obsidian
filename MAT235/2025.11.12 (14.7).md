$$f_{xy}(a,b)=f_{yx}(a,b)$$
**Example 2**
Does there exist a continuous function $f$ such that 
$$f_{x} = 3y^2+x,\
f_{y}=6xy+3x$$
**Solution** 
For such $f$, expect
$$f_{xy}=f_{yx}$$
$$f_{xy} = 6y,\ f_{yx}=6y+3$$
Such $f$ does not exist.

| x\y | 2   | 4   | 6   | 8   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2   | 2   | 4   | 6   | 8   |
| 4   | 3   | 5   | 9   | 12  |
| 6   | 4   | 8   | 12  | 16  |
| 8   | 5   | 10  | 15  | 20  |
(a) $f_\vec{v}(4,4)$, where $\vec{v}= 2i+4j$.
