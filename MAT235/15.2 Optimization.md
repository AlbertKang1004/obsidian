### Example 1
![[Pasted image 20251121145628.png|500]]
Contour of:
$$
f(x,y_{ })  = x^2+ 2y^2+x^{2}y+ 3$$
Verify, that $(2, -1)$, $(0, 0)$, $(-2, 1)$ are **critical points** of $f$.
What type are they?
For $(0,0)$:
- $f_{x}(0, 0) = 0$
- $\displaystyle\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} =  \frac{f(x_{2}, 0) - f(x_{1}, 0)}{x_{2}- x_{1}} = \frac{4-4}{x_{2}- x_{1}} = 0$
- $\displaystyle f_{y}(0,0) = \frac{f(0, y_{2}) - f(0, y_{1})}{y_{2} - y_{1}}=\frac{4-4}{y_{2}-y_{1}} = 0$
For saddle points $(2,-1), (-2, 1)$, they have both **increasing** and **decreasing** direction.
> 💡Observe the symmetry of change of values when finding a saddle.

At a saddle, in some direction it is a **local min** and in some direction it is a **local max**.

## Definition
>$f: \mathbb{R} \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$
- $f$ has a local maximum on $f$ at point $P_{0}$ if $f(P)\leq f(P_{0})$ for every point $P$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
- $f$ has a local minimum on $f$ at point $P_{0}$ if $f(P)\geq f(P_{0})$ for every point $P$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
**Motivation** : $f: [a,b] \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$
- Even if $P_{0}$ is the only critical point, it is not enough to conclude that it is a **global** max/min if the function is bounded.
- either $a$ or $b$ could be the extrema. (since $a, b$ is on the boundary of $f$, it is not differentiable)

### Boundary Point
This refers to points that are neither "inside" the set nor "outside" the set.
![[boundary]]
### Finding Global maximum/minimum
1. Find all critical points of $f$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
2. Investigate whether critical points give a global max/min.
3. If region $\mathbb{R}$ has a boundary, investigate whether $f$ has maximum or minimum on the boundary.

### Example 2
While the quantity of a product demanded by consumers is often a function of the price of the product, the demand for a product may also depend on the price of other products. For instance, the demand for blue jeans at Old Navy may be affected not only by the price of the jeans themselves, but also by the price of khakis. 
Suppose we have two goods whose respective prices are $p_{1}$ and $q_{1}$. The demand for these goods, $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ depend on the prices as
$$q_{1}=150-2p_{1}-p_{2}, q_{2}=200-p_{1}-3p_{2}$$
The seller would like to set the prices $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ in order to maximize revenue. We will assume that the seller meets the full demand for each product. Thus, if we set $R$ be the revenue obtained by willing $q_{1}$ items of the first good at price $p_{1}$ per item and $q_{2}$ items of the second good at price $p_{2}$ per item, we have 
$$R=p_{1}q_{1}+p_{2}q_{2}$$
Where should the seller set the prices $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ to maximize the revenue?
#### Solution
$$\begin{align}
R&=p_{1}(150-2p_{1}-p_{2})+p_{2}(200-p_{1}-3p_{2}) \\[3pt]
&=150p_{1}+200p_{2}-2p_{1}p_{2}-2p_{1}^2-3p_{2}^2
\end{align}
$$

### Example 3
A cardboard box in the shape of a rectangular prism without a lid is to have a volume of $62,500cm^3$. Find the dimensions that minimize the amount of cardboard used.

#### Solution
$V = 62500$
Three sides: $x, y, \displaystyle\frac{62500}{xy}$
Therefore, $A=f(x,y) = xy + \displaystyle \frac{125000}{x}+\frac{125000}{y}$
- $f_{x} = y\displaystyle -\frac{125000}{x^{2} }, \quad f_{y} = x-\displaystyle \frac{125000}{y^2}$
- $x^{2}y=125000,\quad xy^{2}=125000$
- $\displaystyle \frac{x}{y}=1, \quad y=x$
- Now substitute, we get
	- $x\cdot x^{2}=125000$
	- $x=50,y=50$
- $f_{xx}=-\displaystyle\frac{250000}{x^{3}}, \quad f_{xy}=1,\quad f_{yy}=-\frac{250000}{y^3}$
$$\begin{align}
D(50,50) &= \displaystyle \left( -\frac{250000}{50^3} \right)\left( -\frac{250000}{50^3} \right)-(1)^2 \\[3pt]
&=(-2 )( -2) - 1 =3 > 0
\end{align}$$
- and $f_{xx}(50,50)>0$, so we conclude $(50,50)$ is the **global minimum**, since we considered $x>0, y>0$.

> 💡Can we always tell when there is a **global max/min**?

**Theorem (EVT)**:  $f$ is a continuous on a closed and bounded region $\mathbb{R}$ then $f$ has a global minimum.

### Example
Determine if the following region is closed or bounded.
(a) $\{(x,y)\in \mathbb{R}^2\}$
