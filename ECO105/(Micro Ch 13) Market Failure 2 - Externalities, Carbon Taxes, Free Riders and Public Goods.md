## Market Failure with Externalities
> When externalities exist, prices don't reflect all social cost and benefits.
> Markets fail to coordinate private smart choices with social smart choices.
- **Negative externalities** (external costs) — costs to society from your private choice that affect others, but that you do not pay.
	- Examples: Loud music, Air pollution...
- **Positive Externalities** (external benefits) — benefits to society from your private choice that affect others, but that others do not pay you for.
	- Examples: Vaccinations, Public Transits...

>Externalities occur when clear property rights are missing.

### Tragedy of the Commons
The overuse and depletion of a resource that no one can be excluded from because of missing property rights.
- Examples: Overfishing
### Free Riders
Those who consume products or services without paying.
- Examples: Guided by the lighthouse, Group Project...

>When externalities exist, prices don't reflect all social costs and benefits, and markets fail to produce efficient outcomes.

Instead, markets produce...
- Too many products and services with negative externalities
	- Second-hand smoke, pollution, traffic jams
- Too few products and services with positive externalities
	- Vaccinations
