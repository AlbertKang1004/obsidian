## Market Failure with Externalities
> When externalities exist, prices don't reflect all social cost and benefits.
> Markets fail to coordinate private smart choices with social smart choices.
- **Negative externalities** (external costs) — costs to society from your private choice that affect others, but that you do not pay.
	- Examples: Loud music, Air pollution...
- **Positive Externalities** (external benefits) — benefits to society from your private choice that affect others, but that others do not pay you for.
	- Examples: Vaccinations, Public Transits...

>Externalities occur when clear property rights are missing.

### Tragedy of the Commons
The overuse and depletion of a resource that no one can be excluded from because of missing property rights.
- Examples: Overfishing
### Free Riders
Those who consume products or services without paying.
- Examples: Guided by the lighthouse, Group Project...

>When externalities exist, prices don't reflect all social costs and benefits, and markets fail to produce efficient outcomes.

Instead, markets produce...
- Too many products and services with negative externalities
	- Second-hand smoke, pollution, traffic jams
- Too few products and services with positive externalities
	- Vaccinations

## Efficient Pollution
- **Efficient Pollution** balances the additional environmental benefits of lower pollution with additional opportunity costs of reduced living standards
- Socially desirable amount of pollution is not *zero*.
- At some point, additional opportunity costs of reducing pollution are greater than additional benefits of lower pollution
 
When there are externalities, smart choice rule is
- Choose the quantity of output where
$$\begin{align}
\text{Marginal Social Cost} &= \text{Marginal Social Benefit} \\[3pt]
(MSC) &= (MSB)
\end{align}$$
- **Marginal Social Cost** (MSC) = Marginal Private Cost (MC) + Marginal External Cost
	- Marginal External Cost = Price of preventing or cleaning up damage to others external to the original activity
		- ex) Cleaning up the damage to others from my private activity
- **Marginal Social Benefit** (MSB) = Marginal Private Benefit (MB) + Marginal External Benefit
	 - Marginal External Benefit = Price of the value or of the savings to others external to the original activity
		 - ex) Taking public transit, air pollution reduced so someone did not get asthma.

- Between first column and second column, we have inverse relationship just like price/quantity curve.
- Last column represents **Marginal Social Cost** (MSC), where it is 30$ higher than the MC.

## Policies to Internalize Negative Externalities
> Without property rights to the environment, businesses have incentives to save money and improve profits by ignoring external costs like pollution and global warming.

Governments can remedy market failures from externalities by creating social property rights to the environment, making polluting illegal, and penalizing polluters.
- **Emissions tax** — tax to pay for external costs of emissions
	- Carbon tax: emissions tax on carbon-based fossil fuels
	- Smart carbon tax = marginal external cost of damage from emissions
- **Internalize the externality** — transform external costs into costs the producer must pay to the government
![[Figure 13.2]]
### Cap-and-Trade System 
Limits quantities of emissions business can release into environment
- Government auctions off pollution permits to highest bidders
- Total quantity of emissions allowed by permits = emissions target
- Businesses buy and sell emissions permits
## Free Riders and Public Goods
- **Public Goods** — provide external benefits consumed simultaneously by everyone
	- No one can be excluded
	- Public goods like lighthouses and national defense are extreme examples of positive externalities
- **Free-Rider Problem** — markets underproduce products and services with positive externalities
	- With positive externalities, smart social quantity of output is at the intersection of **marginal social benefit** and **marginal social cost** curves
	- Because of the free-rider problem,
		- No single price can coordinate smart individual choices and smart social choices
		- Market-clearing price is too high for buyers to be willing to pay and too low for sellers to be willing to supply

![[Figure 13.3]]
## Subsidies for the Public Good
> When there are positive externalities, government subsidies can get everyone to voluntarily choose the socially best quantity of output where **marginal social benefit** equals **marginal social cost**.

- **Subsidy** (보조금) — payment to those creating positive externalities
	- Smart subsidy = marginal external benefit of savings to others
	- Subsidies remove disconnect between prices for buyers and sellers caused by positive externalities, leading individuals and businesses to voluntarily choose the quantity of output best for society
	- Subsidies to either suppliers or demanders can achieve an efficient social outcome
- **Public Provision** (공공 제공) — government provision of products or services with positive externalities, financed by tax revenue
