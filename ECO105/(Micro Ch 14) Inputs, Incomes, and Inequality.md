## Incomes are Prices and Quantities in Input Markets
> Incomes are determined by prices and quantities in input markets, where households supply to businesses labour, capital, land, and entrepreneurship in exchange for wages, interest, rent, and profits.

![[Circular Flow of Economic Life.png|300]]
- In **input markets**, households are sellers and businesses are buyers.
### Inputs and Incomes

| Input                      | Income                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Labour                     | Wages                                 |
| Capital ($)                | Interest                              |
| Land (and other resources) | Rent                                  |
| Entrepreneurship           | Profits (normal and economic profits) |
-  **Income** — what you earn — is a flow
	- **Flow**: amount per unit of time
	- Income for labour, capital, and land = price of input $\times$ quantity of input.
- **Wealth** — total value of assets — is a stock
	- **Stock** — fixed amount at a moment in time

- Key concepts for explaining input incomes are 
	- **Marginal Revenue Product** for labour
	- **Present Value** for capital
	- **Economic Rent** for land
- Entrepreneurs earn **profits**
	- Entrepreneurs' incomes *not* determined by price $\times$ quantity
	- Economic profits are a **residual** — what is left over from revenues after all opportunity costs of production (including normal profits) have been paid

## Labour and Marginal Revenue Product
- To hire labour, business must pay the market wage reflecting the **best opportunity cost** of an input owner
- Business demand for labour is a **derived demand** — demand for output and profits businesses can derive from hiring labour
- **Marginal Product**: *additional* output from hiring one more unit of labour
	- When businesses hire additional labourers there is **diminishing marginal productivity** — as you add more of a variable input to fixed inputs, the marginal product of the variable input eventually diminishes.
	- **Marginal Revenue Product**: additional revenue from selling output produced by an additional labourer
		- Marginal Revenue Product = Marginal Product $\times$ Price of Output
		- Marginal Revenue Product diminishes for additional labourers

> **Recipe for maximum profits for business**
> Hire additional inputs when marginal revenue product is greater than marginal cost.

## Interest on Capital and Present Value
> Present value compares the price you pay for today's investment against the investment's future earnings.

- The **present value** of a future amount of money is the amount that, if invested today, will grow as large as the future amount, taking account of earned interest.
$$
\text{Present Value} = \frac{\text{Amount of Money available in }n \text{ Years}}{1+ (\text{Interest Rate})^n}
$$
- Easier to start with **future** value of **present** money.
	- If you have $1000 today, interest rate = 12%. 
	  how much will that be worth in the future (1 year)?
	- Add $120 in interest ($1000 $\times$ 0.12) to $1000 = $1120
- What is the **present** value of that **future** $1120 if the interest rate = 12%?
	- $\displaystyle PV=\frac{\$1120}{1.12}=\$1000 \quad [n=1]$
- Should your business invest in a new machine?
	- Costs $1000 and lasts 1 year
	- Generates $1100 in new revenues
	- Interest rate = 12%
	- **Invest when present value of stream of future earnings is greater than the price of the investment.**
	- $\displaystyle PV=\frac{\$1100}{1.12}=\$982 \quad [n=1]$
	- Present value ($982) less than the price of the investment ($1000)
- Future revenues are not worth as much as revenues today because today's revenues earn interest
	- **Discount**: reduction of future revenues for forgone interest
## Land, Economic Rent, and Superstars
> Economists use land as a shorthand for any input in inelastic supply. 
> It applies to land in the sense of property or real estate, but it turns out this concept also applies to **superstars** and explaining their salaries, whether it's in sports, acting, or in music.

- **Economic rent**: income paid to any input in relatively inelastic supply
	- Land is a classic example of an input in inelastic supply
	- For inputs like land in inelastic supply, prices are effectively determined by demand alone
- For most products and services, high input prices cause high output prices.
- For inputs in inelastic supply, high output prices cause high input prices
	- High economic rents: rents are determined by **demand**

Another example inputs in relatively inelastic supply is **superstar talent**.
- The reason that people are willing to pay start athletes incredible amounts of money is because fans are willing to pay a lot of money to see talent, and that talent is in relatively inelastic supply.
